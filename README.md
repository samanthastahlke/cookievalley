Cookie Valley is a Stardew Valley-themed crossover mod for Cookie Clicker. Build coops full of cookies, recruit your favourite villagers, and become the best baker in Pelican Town! (Aside from Evelyn, of course.)

CV is currently only available in English, and may conflict with other mods that modify the news ticker or texture replacement functionality. If you have another mod that replaces any building sprites or the icons.png file, you may experience some inconsistencies or undesired graphical behaviour. Depending on the conflict, these issues might be fixable by adjusting the loading order of mods in the game's settings.

You can find Cookie Valley on the [Steam Workshop!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125868777)

- Reskins for all 20 default buildings, from cursors (junimos) to temples (skull caverns) and beyond, including store and mini building/background sprites
- Reskins for building upgrade/achievement icons
- Over a dozen unique villager sprites
- Reskins "grandmapocalypse" assets to fit the "Jojapocalypse" with a bit of extra Stardew flair
- Hundreds of lines of flavour text riddled with absurd puns to Stardew-ify many achievements, upgrades, and news ticker entries

Eventually, I'd like to add even more custom Stardew-themed content to Cookie Valley, including reskins for building minigames and custom flavoured cookie upgrades. Until then, happy baking!
